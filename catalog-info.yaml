  description: |-
    EventMachine implements a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network
    communications. It's extremely easy to use in Ruby. EventMachine wraps all
    interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs to concentrate on the
    implementation of network protocols. It can be used to create both network
    servers and clients. To create a server or client, a Ruby program only needs
    to specify the IP address and port, and provide a Module that implements the
    communications protocol. Implementations of several standard network protocols
    are provided with the package, primarily to serve as examples. The real goal
    of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs
    using TCP/IP, especially if custom protocols are required.
